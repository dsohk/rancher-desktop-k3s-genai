6. After the Kubernetes services (k3s) is up and running, we can open a terminal console to access to the cluster.
   Open your terminal, you should now have access to your local K3S cluster.

```
❯ kubectl get node
NAME                   STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
lima-rancher-desktop   Ready    control-plane,master   76d   v1.28.5+k3s1
```

Let's deploy GenAI app Open WebUI with ollama into our local k3s cluster.

7. Prepare the `open-webui-values-k3s.yaml` file.

```
ollama:

13. Download the `mistral` LLM from Open WebUI.

![02-openwebui-2](assets/02-openwebui-2.png)


14. Let's try to ask questions to see if the local LLM works.
   For example: `why is the sky blue?  please answer in less than 10 words`

![02-openwebui-3](assets/02-openwebui-3.png)

15. Let's try test the ollama api with command curl
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/chat -d '
{
  "model": "mistral",
  "stream": false,
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "why is the sky blue?  please answer in less than 10 words." }
  ]
} '
```

## Task 2 - Deploy the OpenDGR API gateway protec the GenAI app

Let's deploy OpenDGR onto our local k3s cluster for securing the GenAI apps access.

1.  OpenDGR Deployment with a single line curl command 
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPIsoftwareOSPO/digiRunner_Open/refs/heads/master/manifest/open_dgr.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

2. Enable port-forwarding for open-webui , open-webui-ollama and open-dgr-svc by navigating to Port Forwarding.
   * forward `open-dgr-svc` to port `18080`

   ![image-20241016205503](assets/03-rancher-desktop-port-forwarding-2.png)

3. Navigate to the `http://127.0.0.1:18080/dgrv4/ac4/login` and login with OpenDGR manager.
* 登入帳號: manager

## Task 3 - Multi-Cluster Deployment with Rancher Fleet (Optional)

The GenAI app works great! but the steps to manual deploy and update multiple clusters are too time consuming. 
Lets adopt the GitOps approach to maintain the GenAI app.

1. Go to Rancher Server home page, Click the top left `☰` 3-line bar icon to expand the navigation menu, click `Continuous Delivery`

![rancher-fleet-homepage](assets/04-rancher-fleet-homepage.png)

Before we proced, let's verify if we can see all our clusters in Continous Delivery

![rancher-fleet-cluster-list](assets/04-rancher-fleet-cluster-list.png)

With Rancher Fleet, one can manage individual or group of clusters. Managing cluster via Group reduces adminstrative efforts. 


2. Now we will create a Cluster Group.

Navigate to `Cluster Group` and click on `Create`. 

![rancher-fleet-cluster-group-create](assets/04-rancher-fleet-cluster-group-create.png)

Give it a name `edge`

Under Cluster Selector , click **Add Rule** provide the following values

Key:`env`

Operator: `in list`

Value:`edge` 

we are going to use the same Label which was used to create `edge01` and `edge02` clusters.

![rancher-fleet-cluster-group-edge](assets/04-rancher-fleet-cluster-group-edge.png)
 
3. Once you key in the key:value pair, Rancher will use the selector labels to indentify the clusters to be associated with our newly created cluster group in Rancher Continuous Delivery. You should see it show matches all 2 existing clusters. 

Click on `Create` which will create our first Cluster Group.

![rancher-fleet-cluster-group-added](assets/04-rancher-fleet-cluster-group-added.png)

we can click into the `edge` cluster group for resources details.

![rancher-fleet-cluster-group-details](assets/04-rancher-fleet-cluster-group-details.png)


4. Configure a git repository

we will use the fleet-examples git repo to deploy the Kubernetes sample guestbook application. The app will be deployed into the default namespace.

you can also fork my fleet-examples Git Repository(https://github.com/akiliuhk/fleet-examples) for testing.

In the `Git Repos` page click on `Add Repository`

![rancher-fleet-git-repo-add](assets/04-rancher-fleet-git-repo-add.png)

- Enter `fleet-examples` as your git repo `Name`
- Enter `https://github.com/akiliuhk/fleet-examples` (the fleet-examples git repo URL) in `Repository URL`  

- Enter Paths: `simple` , with all the parameters default setting then click **Next**

Sample output of the GitRepo configuration below

![rancher-fleet-git-repo-add-details1](assets/04-rancher-fleet-git-repo-add-details1.png)

Scroll to bottom
![rancher-fleet-git-repo-add-details2](assets/04-rancher-fleet-git-repo-add-details2.png)

in the Step2, Deploy to `Target` dropdown list, select the Cluster Group we created previosuly `edge` and click Create. 


![rancher-fleet-git-repo-add-details-step2](assets/04-rancher-fleet-git-repo-add-details-step2.png)


We have successfully completed Rancher Contious Delivery (GitOps) configuration. 

![rancher-fleet-git-repo-list](assets/04-rancher-fleet-git-repo-list.png)

5. click into the `fleet-examples` git repo, you can expect the example app will be deployed to the cluster group in a minute.

![rancher-fleet-git-repo-status](assets/04-rancher-fleet-git-repo-status.png)

When there is any commit or updates in the git repo, fleet by default will checks the git repo changes every 15 seconds, then fleet will deploy new changes into the cluster group automatically.


## Conclusion

We successfully set up a Rancher Desktop with K3s to create a local Kubernetes environment. Next, we deployed the GenAI application, OpenWebUI with Ollama, into the local K3s cluster. Finally, we secured the GenAI app using the OpenDGR API gateway. 

As the next step, we will demo to utilize Rancher Fleet to deploy the GenAI applications into the production environment, ensuring scalability and reliability

By following these steps, you can effectively simulate a production environment, test deployments, and manage GenAI app and deploy to large-scale environment.
